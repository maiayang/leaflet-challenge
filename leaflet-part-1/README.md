# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge, we were tasked with creating a Leaflet map showing earthquake data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey). 

First, a dataset was chosen to visualize from USGS. The dataset chosen for this assignment was earthquakes from the past week with a magnitude of 1.0 or higher.

Next, the earthquake data was queried using d3 and plotted on the Leaflet map using their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by their color. A legend was added to the map for reference. Labels were also added showing the location, date, time (converted from Unix), magnitude, and depth of the earthquake.

Help for this code was obtained from:
